# BACKGROUND — Cyberpunk RED: South Night City v5.0 (Phased Test Variant)

For `NEW ENGINE v5.0`. **Round-0 truth**; once play begins, this file is historical and the Ledger changes instead. **Player: customize only the `[UNASSIGNED]` entries before starting.** The GM/engine should withhold `locked_case_truths`, undiscovered NPC knowledge, and hidden faction information from the player during play.

Design: lethal-feeling, resource-constrained street-level edgerunner survival in Night City, 2045. A stolen case holding exactly 1,000 eb is the immediate problem. Corporate negligence, gang predation, and police graft generate separate but intersecting cases. Actors act for their own reasons, evidence is not locked behind a single skill, outcomes are not protected, and the player can reject jobs or change sides. The campaign has four escalating layers, **not four mandatory success gates**.

POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT                 BAND   PRINCIPAL OPPOSITION       REVEAL / CHANGE
1      Q00: Getting Paid               1–3    Harbor Cops                stolen cash is being laundered as seized evidence
2      Medical Supply Run (not a quest yet)         3–5    Iron Sights; AV defenses   the meds are legitimate Trauma Team cargo, contested by several buyers
3      Precinct Blackmail (not a quest yet)         5–7    Harbor Cops; NET security  the extortion ledger is offline in Vance's office
4      Chrome Scavenger (not a quest yet)        7+     Corporate security; mechs a reclamation contractor is profiting from seized chrome
```

The developments below are **possibilities and current case causes**, not an obligatory mission ladder.

### Before starting

- Player sets every `[UNASSIGNED]` field (name, age, appearance, gender, weapon name/type, fixer's name and gender) and picks one role: Solo, Netrunner, Tech, Medtech, Media or Rockerboy. Never generate the player's identity without approval.
- Role gives only justified T1 skills; no automatic T2+, deck, cyberware, money or allies. Netrunning needs an established interface and cyberdeck.
- Set the weapon class from `weapon_and_armour_classes`; reconcile the 30 rounds with it. No armour unless the player has it.
- HP = engine-derived maximum at level 1 (§10.5). Humanity (100) is a setting resource, not HP or MP.
- Then freeze as Round-0 truth: no clock moves, reveals or belief changes during creation.

### Pressure endings (setting-specific; engine §13.5 governs the rest)

- `rent_clock`: payment or a valid new deal retires it; an actual eviction retires it too (lost shelter stays real, no second eviction clock).
- `launder_clock`: stops if the transfer is prevented; a completed transfer retires it. Never re-transfer the same case.
- `crash_recovery`: retires when responders arrive, withdraw or cannot come. `medicine_cold_chain` is separate: retires when the cargo is cooled, spoiled or gone.
- `chrome_transfer`: only the April 16 lot; shipment, lawful hold, loss or cancellation closes it.
- Only Q00 is a quest at Round 0; AV-4, the Vance ledger and Pier Nine are real cases that become quests only on a real offer or commitment.

```yaml
background_id: cyberpunk_red_south_nc_phased_v4_4
provenance: mixed
requested:
  - Cyberpunk Red tone and structure: desperate edgerunners, street-level economy, lethal combat, cyberware.
  - Branching quest machinery triggered by mathematical game states (downtime, grievance, credit).
  - A PC with customizable role/loadout embedded in a living, hostile world with rent due.
  - Factions with belief states, grievance trackers, and specific motivations.
  - High-lethality survival in South Night City; debt, a rented cargo container, and an immediate threat.
  - A simple robbery-recovery opening (Q00), branches on outcomes and faction heat, then a Trauma crash,
    precinct blackmail, and a higher-tier chrome heist.

setting:
  world: Night City, southern waterfront districts. A hard-scrabble 2045 port economy between corporate enclaves,
    abandoned war infrastructure, informal markets, desperate tenants, and franchised policing.
  era: '2045 — Time of the Red'
  starting_region: South Docks Cargo Container Park
  mode: original
  allowed_deviations: Every generated character, allegiance, business, deadline outcome, heist, injury, betrayal,
    life, and death can change through valid world action. No canon or quest outcome is protected.

setting_anchors:
  peoples_or_species:
    - People are human, with highly unequal access to medicine and cybernetic augmentation.
    - Full conversions and military-grade combat machinery exist but are rare at street level and require a cause.
  technology:
    - Local data terminals, agents, smart locks, CCTV, vehicles, drones, medical hardware, and cyberware exist.
    - The old global NET is fractured. NET architectures are local, bounded, physically accessed systems.
    - Netrunning demands appropriate interface hardware, a usable cyberdeck, range/access, and an established skill.
      A player's role title never bypasses these requirements.
    - Cyberware provides only its **specified** capability and has real installation, repair, upkeep, and Humanity
      costs. There is no free chrome, automatic bonus, or instant recovery from severe modification.
    - EMP/empathy consequences follow actual installed hardware and care. Track losses in the Humanity resource;
      describe behavior through established injuries, choices, and consequences, not a universal scripted descent.
    - Corporate security drones and mechs have limited sensors, power, owners, response protocols and logistics.
  institutions:
    - The NCPD has uneven reach; South Dock Harbor Cops are a corrupt contracted policing outfit, not all NCPD.
    - Trauma Team is a medical extraction business with armed recovery and legal corporate claims to cargo.
    - Iron Sights are a territorial boostergang, not a single mind or universally suicidal combatants.
    - Cobalt Reclamation is a private corporate salvage contractor with licensed and illicit work at Pier Nine.
    - Hospitals, unions, tenants, market brokers, auditors, freight offices and corporate insurers continue their
      own business without knowing every plot or instantly noticing every player action.
  economics_or_trade:
    - Eurobucks (eb) buy access, trust, ammunition, food, housing, repairs, therapy and medical treatment.
    - Scarcity matters: back-alley barter, seized goods and credit terms exist, but every lender has conditions.
    - Job pay is negotiated against risk, proof and intermediaries; finding merchandise is not the same as selling it.
  law_and_social_structure:
    - Police and corporate security respond according to contracts, evidence, capability, and jurisdiction.
    - A badge is not absolute immunity, nor is crime automatically detected or perfectly concealed.
    - Combat Zone authority is unreliable; corporate premises are protected by aggressive private enforcement.
  creatures_or_threats:
    - Gang members, dirty patrol officers, paid investigators, independent competitors, drones and rare heavy mechs.
    - Environmental threats include chemical rain, unstable piers, machinery, failed power and crowded escape routes.
  norms:
    law_and_outlaws:
      - Harbor Cops extort locals but avoid targets with credible powerful witnesses or corporate backing.
      - Street people are not uniformly criminal; workers and bystanders prioritize surviving the day.
      - Even violent crews value money, medical help, ammunition, reputation, loyalty and a way out.
    morale:
      ordinary_civilian: flees obvious deadly danger unless protecting someone important or trapped
      local_ganger: tests weak targets and defends friends or turf; withdraws if survival or payment no longer warrants a fight
      corrupt_cop: preserves rank and leverage; calls support or bargains rather than dying for a petty theft
      professional_security: holds while orders, equipment and extraction support remain credible; may withdraw when cut off
      corporate_drone: follows installed control rules until disabled, exhausted, recalled or cut off
      cyberpsycho: dangerous behavior requires an individually established cause; not a default outcome of buying chrome

    history:
      - Grew up or worked long enough in the southern docks to recognize the Harbor Cops and their racket.
      - Twelve hours ago, a dirty Harbor Cop crew ambushed the PC's small crew and took a briefcase containing
        exactly 1,000eb intended for rent. The fate of other crew members is unconfirmed, not assumed fatal.
      - Rents a converted cargo container from Old Man Yul; the full 1,000eb is due by 08:00 April 13.

      - A Harbor van reached the compound after-hours; the intake number was generated afterward.
    state: {case: Lockup C, batch: H-41, cash: 1000eb, transfer: planned for April 13 at 08:00}
    evidence:
      truck_witness: Santi Mercado witnessed a Harbor van heading toward the compound after the ambush.
      docket: the registry shows a post-event intake number and inconsistent officer signoffs.
      officer: Basco saw the distinctive case and can identify its custody marking.
      claim: a property-claim mismatch can be verified by Lita Morrow using independent intake records.
      guard: the compound has one desk officer plus perimeter coverage; access is an encounter governed by
        actual security, social pressure and skills, not a guaranteed successful trick.
      audit: Holt's own paperwork ties the case to Lockup C and the settlement batch.
    routes: Evidence-based claim and audit; civilian witness plus pressure through an intermediary; bargaining with
      informed officers; or risky direct access to the compound. Any of these can establish where the case is;
      none mandates a specific class or a violent entry.
    trajectory: on transfer, the particular bag or cash may be split up; the custody record remains a viable
      link to Vance's accounting and Q02 even if Q00 cannot be completed.

  av4_case:
    cause: At 07:50 April 12 a mechanical control fault caused Trauma Team AV-4 TT-17 to land hard near the Combat
      Zone. It carried contractually owned clinic cargo including refrigerated clotting compounds and basic emergency
      kits. Separate defensive systems still protect the crash site. The Iron Sights noticed the incident and want
      sellable medications; Trauma Team intends recovery. These parties do not share a secret master plan.
    state:
      crew: Vale and the two pilots are alive at the site; one pilot is immobilized in the cockpit and the
        other stays inside to monitor emergency communications
      cargo: one main refrigerated medical pod and two smaller cases displaced by the impact
      chain_of_custody: Trauma Team's manifest remains on dispatch systems
    evidence:
      beacon: local distress reports and smoke lead to the downed craft without a fixer introduction.
      medic: Vale knows the crash cause, legal owner, medical needs and surviving refrigerated cargo.
      manifest: dispatch and clinic receipts independently identify clinical buyers, lot numbers and cargo rights.
      scouts: Zip reports the first gang sightings; following the gang's market chatter points to potential buyers.
      cooling: medical sensor labels visibly show whether individual cases still meet storage conditions.
    routes: Rescue or verified delivery on Trauma terms; independently tracing clients to bargain for a legal
      recovery fee; negotiation with the gang or a street doc; competing salvage with legal and reputational risks;
      or refusing the job. Medical cargo can be identified from witnesses, labels, dispatch or clinicians without NET.
    trajectory: responders and gang members try to secure salvage; remaining supply value and obligations change
      with actual time, care and custody.

  extortion_ledger_case:
    cause: Vance maintains a fully offline, unencrypted personal extortion ledger on a terminal in his precinct
      office to reconcile bribes and diverted seizures. The basement NET stores only dispatch metadata, entry logs
      and camera records. His true ledger is **not** on the NET. Receipts and witness statements corroborate it.
    state: {ledger: Vance's private office, corroboration: multiple independent public and contractor records}
    evidence:
      forms: Holt's repeated seizure signoffs match unusual transfer times on dock paperwork.
      audit: Ortez is already comparing suspicious reimbursement batches, but lacks enough proof to name Vance.
      net: precinct visitor, camera and access metadata show irregular after-hours office visits, not ledger contents.
      shipments: Cobalt-return paperwork matches some extortion ledger delivery dates.
      sources: affected vendors and Lita Morrow can substantiate dates or unusual receipt formats.
      office: the unencrypted ledger is accessible only through actual control of the offline office terminal or
        cooperation from someone already entitled to access it.
    routes: Independent accounting investigation and auditors; witness coalition; authorized documentary disclosure;
      credible bargaining with someone possessing records; or dangerous precinct access. Netrunning can corroborate
      but cannot reach an unplugged ledger over NET. The case is provable without exclusive digital evidence.
    trajectory: if Vance detects a credible leak he may relocate or erase his own ledger, but copies, witnesses,
      invoices and the auditor's independent discrepancy remain in the world.

  pier_nine_case:
    cause: Cobalt Reclamation's Pier Nine yard handles ordinary licensed salvage while Dax Orrell diverts a small
      off-book channel of cyberware seized without proper ownership or patient authorization. Some pieces were
      delivered through Vance, others were bought from Iron Sights intermediaries. Three rare neural-interface
      assemblies sit in a secure annex before a scheduled April 16 transfer. They offer possible progression only
      after proof of compatibility, safe installation, payment/ownership, and actual Humanity costs.
    state:
      manager: Dax Orrell directs diversion and attempted shipment
      technician: Edda Quill has inconsistent serial-number records, not the full criminal history
      inventory: three rare neural-interface assemblies plus common replacement parts, still subject to transfer
    evidence:
      street_doc: Dr Kemi can connect unexplained cyberware sales to recurring Cobalt batches.
      harbor_forms: the Harbor Cop custody trail independently names Pier Nine as a recipient of certain seized goods.
      gang_market: Iron Sights buyers know Cobalt pays premiums for identifiable intact implants.
      warranty: Quill's recorded serial conflicts and test notes show discrepancies with ownership declarations.
      auction: ordinary public sale documents show a repeated pattern of withdrawn lots and private exemptions.
      consent: clinical records and actual claimants can disprove corporate declarations that removal was authorized.
    routes: Documented claim or negotiated purchase, protected whistleblower disclosures, insured audit and legal
      recovery, deals with salvage intermediaries, or a high-risk direct recovery at Pier Nine. Multiple independent
      trails lead to the yard and the off-book stock; success does not require completing Q01 or Q02 first.
    trajectory: Dax moves or sells what he still controls on schedule and defends his interests through available
      people, contracts and machinery. Exposing the scheme may stop sales but does not grant chrome to the PC.

## Setting notes (GM-facing)

- Trackers are bookkeeping, not mind-reading: Harbor retaliation needs an actor who learns the facts through a real channel, even at grievance 2+. A lapsed laundering deadline creates no grievance by itself.
- The 1000eb case exactly pays the rent and is not a bounty; no fixer cut on recovering one's own cash.
- Humanity has no universal loss per install: set each item's cost before an installation is resolved.
- Danger stays non-graphic: conveyed through time, injury, space, money and consequence.
