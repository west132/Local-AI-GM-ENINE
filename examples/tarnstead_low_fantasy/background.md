# BACKGROUND — Tarnstead: The Drowned Marches v5.0 (Phased Test Variant)

For `NEW ENGINE v5.0`. **Round-0 truth.** Once play begins, this document is historical; changes belong to the Ledger, not the background. **Player: customize `[UNASSIGNED]` fields before Turn 1.** The engine must not expose `locked_case_truths`, private NPC knowledge, or hidden faction beliefs as character knowledge without an in-world channel.

Design: Grounded mud-and-steel low fantasy. The PC comes to the rainbound logging town of Tarnstead pursuing a **50-silver-stag bounty** on Kaelen, a thief who stole a noble's iron reliquary while seeking money to help his ill sister. Kaelen has opened it. Ordinary injustice and desperate survival collide with an old ward coming apart beneath the bog. Factions act on their own knowledge and resources; the PC can hunt, shelter, negotiate, investigate, exploit the crisis, or leave. **Four directions of play are possibilities, not mandatory choices or protected endings.**

```text
POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT                 BAND   LIKELY OPPOSITION       REVEAL / CHANGE
1      Q00: The Mud-Stained Bounty       1–3    Bailiff's men; locals   The fugitive shelters with hungry outlaws
2      The Opened Box (not a quest yet)              3–5    Competing claimants     The supposedly valuable prize held a ward-stone
3      Bog-Rot (not a quest yet)                 5–7    Flood; the Drowned      The cracked ward is waking peat-preserved dead
4      Sealing the Mire (not a quest yet)            7+     Flooded ruins; Warden  The seal can be repaired, but at a real cost
```

The directions below are **illustrative existing causes**, not committed future quests or a guaranteed sequence.

### Before starting

- Player sets every `[UNASSIGNED]` field: name, age, origin (Capital or Free Cities), appearance, archetype (Veteran, Ranger, Hedge-Knight, Outlaw, Exile or Crow-Catcher), gender, and the blade's name and class. No archetype grants free gear, office, allies, horse, spells or money.
- The two T2 skills reflect past field work; fit their `class_source` to the archetype, or revise them with the player's approval.
- HP = engine-derived maximum (§10.5). This campaign uses `vitality`, not levels or XP.
- Money: 72 cp = 3 ss 12 cp (1 ss = 20 cp). The sword's T2 is quality, not a damage bonus; the armour is genuinely worn.
- At Round 0 Kaelen and Elara live, the Baron doesn't know where the box is, the Drowned haven't reached Tarnstead, and the PC has no faction tie.

### Pressure endings (setting-specific; engine §13.5 governs the rest)

- `rising_water`: dry weather may simply stop it; if flooding turns into damage and rebuilding, replace it with one aftermath process.
- `ward_failure`: repair or isolation retires it; an actual breach retires it and, only if danger persists, one containment process replaces it. The Drowned follow real waterways, not a regional invasion.
- `elara_health`: care, death, removal from the shard or relocation closes or reshapes it; never add a second village-disease clock.
- `search_sweep`: retires when the sweep succeeds, fails, is recalled or loses authority.
- `mill_provisions`: resupply, dispersal or camp closure ends it; it is not a regional famine.
- Only Q00 is a quest at Round 0. The reliquary, the bog-rot and the threshold remedy are real cases that become quests only on a real offer or commitment.

```yaml
background_id: tarnstead_low_fantasy_phased_v4_4
provenance: mixed
requested:
  - 'Low-fantasy setting: realistic medieval combat, rare and subtle magic, grim but emotional story.'
  - 'A strong narrative hook with moral ambiguity (law vs. empathy vs. survival).'
  - 'Branching quest machinery triggered by player choices and faction alignment.'
  - 'A PC with a customizable but grounded role (veteran, bounty hunter, exile).'

setting:
  world: The Drowned Marches, a frontier of wet forest, peat bog and ruined old stone. Tarnstead survives on timber,
    charcoal, river barges and the labour of tenants who owe the Baron more than they can usually pay.
  era: late Iron-Age / early medieval equivalent; fictional local calendar
  starting_region: The Rusty Boar Inn, Tarnstead
  mode: original
  allowed_deviations: Every generated alliance, survival, death, arrest, escape, recovery, political settlement,
    discovery and confrontation can change through valid action. Neither the Baron's rule nor the seal's fate is protected.

setting_anchors:
  peoples_or_species:
    - Human communities only. Tales of Bog-men and Old Ones are folklore to most townsfolk.
    - The Drowned are reanimated human dead preserved in peat, not a speaking civilization or common fantasy species.
  powers_or_supernatural_rules:
    - No visible spellcasting, spell lists, or universally accessible magic. Effects require a previously established
      object, place, historical act, bound being or deliberate slow working; they have location, conditions and limits.
    - The broken lock-stone has unbound part of an old threshold beneath the marches. It alters bog water and can
      animate bodies formerly confined by that threshold. Proximity and exposure matter. It does not spread to
      everybody automatically or give the PC a spellcasting ability.
    - The original ward was made by people long dead. Its mechanical stone seating, iron restraint and marked
      alignments can be physically restored if recovered components survive. No blood sacrifice is required.
    - The Drowned do not respond to pain or fear, but can be obstructed, trapped, carried by current, or rendered
      unable to move. They do not navigate freely beyond the waterways and old routes without a causal path.
    - Healing is mundane. Herbs and clean dressings can help an ordinary wound; severe infection is dangerous and
      can worsen despite treatment. Rebinding the ward does not retroactively cure infection or restore the dead.
    - No one recognizes every rune or supernatural symptom by default. Understanding requires legible evidence,
      personal expertise, comparison, or a knowledgeable person.
  technology:
    - Forged iron, woodwork, leather, rope, pulleys, riverboats, wagons, mills, forges, crossbows and simple locks.
    - Firearms, modern communications, electric light and modern medicine do not exist.
    - Literacy is uncommon. Taxes, writs and old histories are controlled chiefly by manor officials and clergy.
  institutions:
    - Baron Osvin Harrow holds Tarnstead under a feudal grant; Bailiff Thorne collects rents and enforces his writs.
    - The Chantry condemns forbidden Old Woods practices but ordinary village priests chiefly tend the sick and dead.
      A small record-room survives beside Tarnstead's chapel; it has no army or unlimited occult knowledge.
    - Village households, cutters, ferrymen, charcoal makers and informal mutual-aid groups continue to pursue
      daily survival regardless of the bounty.
  religions_or_beliefs:
    - Most families follow the Chantry's rites in public while observing older bogland burial customs in private.
    - Some treat the Old Works as cursed, others as forgotten drainage architecture, with no consensus proof.
  economics_or_trade:
    - Silver Stags (ss) and Copper Pennies (cp), with 1 ss = 20 cp. Taxes and wages often also use grain or timber.
    - Winter stores, passable roads, dry fuel and access to a healer may be more valuable than loose coin.
    - Bounties are paid only by whoever actually controls the treasury; possessing a writ does not guarantee honest payment.
  law_and_social_structure:
    - The Baron claims summary authority over stolen noble property. Theft may be punished by execution or maiming.
    - A bailiff's command is not supernatural compulsion; local captains, witnesses and powerful patrons can resist
      or dispute him if they have material reason and sufficient means.
    - A writ authorizes a claim to reward under its actual terms, not indiscriminate killing, a military command,
      lawful right to raid every home, or immunity from testimony and reprisal.
  creatures_or_threats:
    - Hungry deserters, predatory men, wolves, bad roads, falling timber, flash floods, disease and ruined bridges.
    - Peat-preserved Drowned may wake in small numbers near the breached waterways and old burial routes.
    - The ancient Bog-Warden is a distinct bound guardian at the lower threshold. Its purpose is to defend the old
      boundary, not to hunt the PC as a predetermined final boss.
  norms:
    law_and_outlaws:
      - Local people value shelter, labour, kin, crops and whether another person pays their share of a loss.
      - Thorne values visible order and his position; a guard has personal obligations rather than generic evil.
      - The outlaws are not a unified rebellion. Some stole food, some fled levies, and some are violent opportunists.
    morale:
      peasant: flees obvious lethal danger unless protecting kin or trapped
      hungry_outlaw: threatens or fights with an advantage; retreats if wounded, leaderless or offered survival
      bailiff_guard: keeps formation while support and discipline hold; may surrender if isolated or betrayed
      trained_veteran: weighs objective, orders and available retreat rather than dying for a lost position
      drowned: no fear or pain response; stops only when restrained, disrupted or its binding changes
      bog_warden: obeys its established ward duty and does not automatically pursue beyond its boundary

    class_sources:
      ELITE: sustained elite soldiery, hard campaigns or exceptional taught discipline supported by history
      LEGENDARY: exceptionally rare and demonstrable mastery; being a hedge-knight or noble alone is insufficient

      T2: ordinary serviceable forged iron, chain, hardened leather or professional tools
      T3: unusually well-made steel, fine specialized tools and armour

      axe_or_spear: ordinary melee weapon; resolve base harm and reach by engine §10.5
      longbow_or_crossbow: ranged weapon; requires established weapon, ammunition and workable conditions
      worn_chain_and_leather: medium protective clothing/armour; coverage and soak depend on engine §10.5 and condition
      drowned_peat_shroud: not armour; resistance to pain is not reduction of every physical hit

      local_terrain: The Whispering Bogs hold sinkholes and tracks wash away in rain.
      rumour: Some cutters say that old stones near the drowned mill are unlucky; this is hearsay, not proof.

content_bounds:
  depicts:
    - Realistic, non-graphic medieval danger, hardship and consequences.
    - Feudal coercion, theft, poverty, moral ambiguity, illness and atmospheric supernatural dread.
    - Investigation, travel, negotiation and rare dangerous confrontations.
  excludes:
    - Graphic gore or prolonged injury detail.
    - Sexual content or sexual violence.
    - Detailed torture or self-harm depiction.
    - Flashy spellcasting, ubiquitous magic and conventional nonhuman fantasy societies.
  notes: Keep the story grounded. The horror should arise through evidence, strange water, silences and the cost of
    choices, not prolonged depictions of suffering. No faction, PC, witness or key NPC has plot armour.

  reliquary_theft:
    cause: The Baron's grandfather took the intact lock-stone from the Old Threshold and kept it in an iron, lead-lined
      travelling casket. While the stone was intact and enclosed, the distant restraint held, though weakened by removal.
      The Baron knew the ancestral warning, concealed provenance and ordered its recovery as valuable family property.
      Kaelen stole it hoping to sell its contents for treatment of Elara's pre-existing infection; he expected money,
      found a carved stone, and accidentally cracked it trying to pry it from its setting yesterday at the mill.
    state:
      box: Physically present with Kaelen; lid opened and catch bent; iron shell not smashed.
      first_fragment: With Kaelen, wrapped near Elara, causing unnatural staining on contact.
      second_fragment: Wedged under the millwheel sluice grate, detectable in low or diverted water.
      small_chips: Grit near the broken box lining, insufficient alone to re-seat the lock.
    evidence:
      iron_casing: The casket's three-notch marks match old threshold drawings and a repair diagram.
      shard: The carried fragment fits a corresponding stone outline in the casket, with a clean crack face.
      mill_sluice: A distinctive pale fracture edge and bitter water point to the submerged second fragment.
      ysabet_records: Old diagrams and a warning survive in the estate chest independent of Kaelen's testimony.
      elara_history: Iva and local spinners know Elara had fever before the theft, disproving a simple single-cause story.
      baron_admission: Baron Osvin knows the contents are a ward-stone, but is unlikely to confess without cause.
    routes: Discover the theft through witness accounts, box marks, estate inventory, Elara's illness history, or
      Kaelen. Recover the missing fragment through sluice examination, water diversion, or a guided search.
    discovered_information: {}
  ward_break:
    cause: The fracture interrupted the old restraint. Affected water seeps up where broken stone and the old
      threshold's connected channels are present. Elara's gray stain followed direct handling of the fragment,
      separate from her pre-existing infection. Drowned bodies in older peat burials may gradually become animate.
    state: {staining: localized, drowned: one stirring below tomb, townspeople_consensus: none}
    evidence:
      bad_water: Bitter springwater near the mill, but upstream household wells remain normal for now.
      old_songs: Anwen's burial list repeats 'stone whole, iron down, water low' beside the three-notch symbol.
      traces: Strange slow impressions emerge near old peat burials; shape and water disturbance can be observed.
      elara: Her new markings began after touching the shard and lessen when it is moved away, though fever remains.
      records: The manor note speaks of restoring the restraint before the seep reaches the wider channels.
      other_witness: Tavin noticed the old spring rising against the river's level, which ordinary rain alone fails to explain.
    routes: Compare different water sites, Elara's earlier illness, Anwen's records, Tavin's reports, fresh peat signs,
      manor history or the exposed mill drain. No single magical-sensing skill is required.
    discovered_information: {}
  drowned_path:
    cause: A breached sequence of underground peat channels links burial mounds, millrace and the Drowned Tomb.
      Early disturbances remain localized. High water widens paths and can bring buried dead toward used crossings.
    state: {active_path: lower millrace and tomb, alternate_access: peat-side stair}
    evidence:
      mill_collapse: New masonry break under the wheel pit descends to the old court.
      peat_stakes: Tavin can follow older stakes to a second stair at low water.
      register: Anwen's old funeral route map describes the upper mound's stone landing.
      strong_current: Floating reeds move into an underground cleft during river ebb.
    routes: Locate and approach the tomb through the mill, peat-side markers, records or observable currents; access
      conditions and costs differ as water rises. Entry is never automatically safe.
    discovered_information: {}
  old_threshold:
    cause: The original lock-stone fits a carved three-notch socket in the lower gate. Once both large pieces
      are recovered, a skilled worker can align them under the iron restraint in the old threshold and secure them
      with clamps. The repaired broken ward suppresses further awakening but is less durable than the former whole
      stone and needs periodic inspection. The first protective move is positioning and lowering the old iron bar;
      lasting repair requires clamps and stable dry working space. If a piece is lost, builders could eventually
      reconstruct a new restraint from the old gate design, but that takes substantial labour and time.
    state:
      socket: present at lower threshold
      lower_bar: jammed but intact; needs force, leverage, cleared sediment or repair to move
      needed_material: both large fragments plus strong forged clamps for lasting reassembly
      alternate_strategy: evacuation, barricades and redirecting water protect people temporarily but do not heal the ward
    evidence:
      manor_diagram: Ysabet's old map shows stone alignment and a marked clamp that workers can copy.
      chantry_record: Anwen's short instruction gives the order 'stone whole, iron down, water low'.
      gate_marks: Actual worn outlines accept the two halves only in the proper orientation.
      old_iron: A serviceable forge can make clamps if the metal and smith time are obtained.
      bog_warden: It responds to matching stone marks and a lowered restraint, and may stand aside when the charge is met.
    routes: Learn the mechanical remedy through physical socket study, manor diagram, Chantry record, or the
      Bog-Warden's response. Compel or recruit labour from the Baron, outlaws or villages, or undertake difficult
      work independently. A purely political settlement or defeating the Warden does not itself mend the boundary.

  environment:
    weather: Cold rain falling steadily; earlier rains have saturated the banks.
    streets: Mud, deep ruts, a few wagons coming in early.
    rivers: High and turbid, ferry still moving in daylight if the boatman judges it safe.
    inn: Thorne is questioning Gerda in the common room; two guards stand under the eaves outside.
  material_history:
    - Elara fell ill with a camp fever days before the theft and stopped working.
    - Kaelen took the Baron's iron box two nights ago while seeking money for treatment.
    - Kaelen reached the mill and opened it yesterday, breaking the lock-stone while prying it loose.
    - Strange seepage began near the wheelrace; the broader town has not identified its cause.
  unowned_facts:
    visible:
      - A bounty writ for Kaelen promises 50 silver stags and demands the supposedly unbroken iron box.
      - The Baron's armed men have increased questioning and modest patrols.
      - Rain has worsened for several weeks, but Tarnstead's main roads still function.
    hidden:
      - The Baron's family kept the lock-stone after an old theft from the Drowned Tomb.
      - The second large ward fragment lies below the mill sluice grate.
      - The Warden follows a limited binding charge, not the Baron's political interests.

### Directions the setting supports (design intent, never a menu)

- **The Baron's Hound:** proof, the property or the Baron's trust leads to a real offer of continued work. Thorne competes; the ward secret can wreck the bargain.
- **King of the Marches:** real help to the outlaws earns trust and maybe a role by negotiation. The camp is hungry and divided; Tomwen is not a subordinate.
- **Warden of the Deep:** relic clues, records and witnesses reveal the Old Threshold and its remedy. Fragments, forge, labour and water are scarce; the Warden keeps its own rules.
- **The Drifter:** leaving by a real road, ferry or contract. People left behind live or die on their own.

The bounty can be earned, contested, ignored or renegotiated; directions overlap and none forecloses another. Never offer them as an A–D choice.
