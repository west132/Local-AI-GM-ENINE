# BACKGROUND — The Last Scion of the Boundary v5.0

For **NEW ENGINE v5.0**. **Round-0 truth**. Once play starts, the background is historical; actual events belong in the save/ledger. GM-only hidden truths must not be narrated as Julian's knowledge. This is a separate, original campaign.

**Central premise.** Seventeen-year-old Julian Ardent, the last heir of a failing frontier house, faces Lord Cassian Vane's invading coalition. The **fielded forces are outnumbered three to one**, and the immediate story begins with Commander Sola testing the outer gate. Julian recently took an ancient iron family ring from his father's desk. **The ring's power to bring victory is only an old family rumour. It has produced no demonstration, advice, active voice, or confirmed advantage at Round 0.** The first manifestation of its hidden occupant, a soul carrying memories from lost timelines, is conditional and happens *during play*, not in the prologue.

**Existing relationship, not a romance script.** Julian is betrothed to Lady Elowen Merewyn. Her father Aldren, the closest friend of Julian's late father, supplied House Ardent with grain, iron, timber, and credit for years. Aldren was recently assassinated as part of Vane's operation, disrupting a real supply system. House Merewyn is **not** a rival house. It has its own grief, succession, risks, and free choices. In a lost timeline, Julian's pride and fear that Merewyn would gain control of Ardent stopped him from asking for help. This is private history remembered by the ring's soul, not a forced present-day mistake.

**Possible directions are not promised outcomes:** defend or abandon the gate, request support, investigate Aldren's assassination, expose or bargain with Cassian, work with or against Sola, lose or preserve the estate, question the ring. No revelation, death, romance, betrayal, victory, defeat, or new story arc is mandatory.

background_id: last_scion_boundary_v4_4
provenance: mixed
requested:
  - A proud, rude, grieving 17-year-old noble boy is the last heir holding a failing border estate and facing the first assault.
  - The invading rival force outnumbers the defender force three to one.
  - The family ring is reputed to bring victory, but this is only a rumour until the past soul starts to appear.
  - A harsh old-sounding soul in the ring carries knowledge of previous lost timelines and challenges Julian's pride.
  - Julian has a fiancee from a long-time supplying allied family; their head was Julian's parent's best friend, not an enemy.
  - A rival's assassination of that allied head broke the established supply relationship.
  - In a lost timeline Julian was too proud to ask that family for aid and feared being overtaken by it.
  - Master Orlo, Captain Joram, Lord Cassian of House Vane and former Ardent vassal Commander Sola are central actors.
setting:
  world: The March of Greyfen, a fortified frontier between the Crown of Valenne and the contested border principalities. Harvests, tolls, family obligation, roads, and military logistics govern power more often than magic.
  era: late medieval-inspired original world; Year 482 of the Crown Reckoning
  starting_region: Greywatch Hold, House Ardent's boundary fortress
  mode: original
  allowed_deviations: Any character may live, leave, negotiate, change loyalty or die through established events. Julian has no plot armour. Wars, titles, betrothals, territory, families, and the ring's use may change through valid action. No required victory or loop reset.
setting_anchors:
  peoples_or_species:
    - Humans comprise known frontier polities. Folklore about ancestral spirits exists; public proof is rare.
  powers_or_supernatural_rules:
    - Most reputed relic powers and family legends have no demonstrated effect. No general spellcasting, instant healing, automatic prophecy, or supernatural success bonus exists.
    - The Ardent victory ring has no established power at Round 0 beyond its historical material existence. Its reputation for bringing victory is rumour, not an objective or mechanical guarantee.
    - The ring contains one specific latent temporal witness bound by a one-time ancient boundary oath. Its cause, trigger, knowledge, and limits are in locked_case_truths.ring_echo. Only actual manifestation supplies evidence of its unusual function.
    - A recollection of an erased timeline is memory of a former event, not a law governing the present. Changed actors, missing resources, intelligence, weather and decisions can make every prediction wrong.
    - The ring cannot compel Julian's choices, improve an attack roll, protect a wearer, invent a rescue or guarantee any further reversal of time.
  technology:
    - Fortified keeps, crossbows, bows, shields, horse messengers, wagons, mills, forge shops, barges and siege equipment. No firearms or instant long-distance communications.
  institutions:
    - House Ardent holds the Greyfen border by royal charter but receives irregular crown support.
    - House Merewyn owns independent granaries, mills, ironworks and upland roads under its own charter; it is an old ally, not a subordinate of House Ardent.
    - House Vane has assembled a rival coalition of charter claimants, hired soldiers and discontented border lords; its claims are political assertions, not automatic lawful command over Greywatch.
    - Village headmen, chapels, merchant carters, retainers and lesser border houses maintain their own loyalties, debts and needs.
  religions_or_beliefs:
    - People honour ancestral dead and oath-bound stone boundaries, but ordinary families treat tales of victory rings as unverified lineage lore.
  economics_or_trade:
    - Coin, grain, livestock, carts, seasonal roads and iron stocks are finite. Credit and supply need somebody willing and able to sign, escort, and deliver.
    - One silver mark (sm) equals 20 copper pennies (cp); an unpaid pledge is never spendable coin.
  law_and_social_structure:
    - Julian inherits limited authority within Ardent holdings. He cannot order Merewyn soldiers, grain or messengers without that house's permission.
    - Betrothal creates a politically meaningful promise but neither automatic ownership nor a guaranteed marriage or unconditional alliance.
    - Garrison officers may refuse a plainly impossible order or withdraw if duty and survival fail; troops and civilians are not interchangeable force totals.
  creatures_or_threats:
    - Armed raiders, blockades, hunger, untreated injuries, fatigue, frightened levies, fires, weak bridges and siege engines.
    - The ring's possible spirit is not a publicly established source of spells or combat bonuses.
  norms:
    law_and_outlaws:
      - Frontier soldiers value shelter, reliable commanders, rations and the survival of home communities.
      - Noble rank matters for lawful rights and obligations but does not force obedience from independent peers.
      - Leaders respond to evidence, actual resources and reported losses rather than perfect knowledge of Julian's intentions.
    morale:
      hungry_militia: Holds on familiar defended ground with leadership and food; may scatter if isolated or clearly overwhelmed.
      arden_retainer: Loyal to house and companions but may reject pointless sacrifice after a real collapse.
      professional_infantry: Preserves formations when supplied and commanded; retreats when objectives or support fail.
      experienced_commander: Negotiates, withdraws or presses advantage by knowledge and position, not genre expectations.
  prices:
    currency: silver marks (sm), copper pennies (cp); 1 sm = 20 cp
    living:
      simple_hot_meal: 2 cp when available
      horse_fodder_day: 5 cp
      hired_messenger_day: 4 cp plus access or hazard pay
    war:
      infantry_pay_week: 2 sm for a regular when treasury can pay
      cart_grain: 18 sm plus transport and escort if sellers have stock
      iron_gate_repairs: material and skilled labour required; cash alone cannot finish before a battle

player:
  identity:
    name: Julian Ardent
    age: 17
    origin: Greywatch Hold, the March of Greyfen
    history:
      - Last living child and immediate heir of the late Lord Edric Ardent. Raised for border stewardship but has never commanded a full siege.
      - Edric's long-time friend Lord Aldren Merewyn supplied Greywatch with grain, wagon timber and iron under signed reciprocal accounts. Their families arranged Julian's betrothal to Aldren's daughter Elowen.
      - Edric died in the last winter's border illness. The estate's strength and revenues have since declined.
      - Aldren was assassinated four days ago. The supply convoys suspended movement as competing authorized signers, nervous guards and a damaged road contract obstructed deliveries.
      - Julian took an old, heavy iron ring from Edric's locked desk last evening. His family claims the ring once brought battle victories, but he has witnessed nothing unusual from it.
    status: Unmarried betrothed heir of a threatened minor border house; legal hold over Greywatch but no command over Merewyn.
  appearance: Young, severe and formal despite tired eyes; practical dark riding coat over a worn, tailored brigandine; heir's signet at the collar.
  archetype: embattled young border lord
  job: hereditary castellan and garrison commander in law, still dependent on experienced officers in practice
  belongs: [house_ardent]
  gender: male
  character: Proud, sharp-tongued and defensive, grieving and afraid of seeming incapable; these are starting tendencies, not compulsory choices. He can ask for help, change his attitude, surrender, refuse a fight or mature according to the player's decisions.
  status: Exhausted by mourning, accounts and preparations; still on his feet, not physically injured.
  starting_activity: At Greywatch's outer gate with Joram and a bell-ringer as scouts report Sola's leading formation approaching the causeway; no assault has yet been adjudicated.

  traits:
    - Julian is the recognized Ardent heir under his own charter; allegiance is not an automatic promise of unquestioning obedience.
    - Grief, pride and being seventeen provide neither automatic penalties nor secret tactical competence; resolve relevant circumstances normally.
    - The old ring provides no proved supernatural benefit at the start.

  knowledge:
    facts:
      ring_rumour: Stories claim that the ring helped Ardent ancestors win battles. Julian has no proof, voice, or abilities from it.
      merewyn_tie: Aldren was his father's closest friend and helped supply Greywatch for years; Aldren was recently assassinated and shipments halted.
      elowen: Elowen Merewyn is his fiancée; marriage and aid are not yet negotiated in the present crisis.
      invasion: Cassian Vane asserts a rival boundary claim; Commander Sola is a former minor Ardent vassal who knows Greywatch.
      numbers: Reliable scouts estimate about 360 Vane coalition combatants against approximately 120 armed Ardent defenders in the campaign area.
    channels: [direct observation, household orders, Orlo's ledgers, Joram's scouts, named messengers, letters from known nobles]
content_bounds:
  depicts: [tense frontier war, loss and grief, political pressure, feudal obligations, non-graphic armed conflict, family expectation, difficult allegiances]
  excludes: [graphic gore, prolonged injury detail, sexual content, sexual violence, detailed suicide or self-harm depiction, torture detail]
  notes: Julian and Elowen are young. Their betrothal is political and personal history, not a guaranteed romance, consummation, or marriage. Non-graphic stakes, independent decisions and meaningful agency.

    name: Greywatch Hold
    conditions:
      surface: Old hill fort with an occupied inner keep, battered outer curtain and a small chapel and storehouse.
      access: Julian's soldiers command known entrances; discipline, bribes, damage and Sola's previous knowledge can change access.
      weakness: A northern retaining wall has loose masonry; culvert sluice under the south slope can carry a small party at low water if its grate is opened.

      status: assembled under competing contractual and noble commitments
      limits: total count is 3 times Greywatch's 120 defenders at Round 0; not every soldier can attack the same gate at once or fight without supply

locked_case_truths:
  merewyn_assassination:
    cause: Lord Cassian chose to sever Greywatch's longstanding supply link without a pitched battle against Merewyn. He paid broker Maud Lorne, who hired Garrick Pell to assassinate Lord Aldren Merewyn four days before Round 0. Aldren's death forced the estate into succession procedures and convoy signature checks, while Pell's associates damaged Greystep bridge to delay loaded carts. Merewyn itself did not conspire against Ardent.
    prior_events:
      - Edric Ardent and Aldren Merewyn were closest friends and made a written bilateral grain and iron supply compact years ago.
      - Aldren was murdered four days before the outer-gate approach; his convoy authority consequently stopped.
      - Someone paid to damage the Greystep bridge, separate from the mere fact of Aldren's death.
    state:
      culpability: Cassian commissioned Lorne who hired Pell; Lorne and Pell are still able to move and make their own choices.
      public_belief: The murder is known but Vane's role has not been proved.
      compact: Not legally cancelled; deliveries interrupted by governance, physical route and security.
    evidence:
      payment: Partial Vane household transfer tallies in Lorne's correspondence, with checkable clerk stamps and separate banked receipts.
      route: Cart-hire records, paid outrider sightings and bridge-repair witness can tie Pell's associates to Greystep.
      personal: A former Merewyn gate porter noticed Pell asking unusual questions and can identify his appearance, not Cassian by itself.
      broker: Lorne and a payment courier possess independent knowledge of the commission chain.
    routes: Follow cart accounts and bridge work, interview witnesses and staff, track Lorne's courier/payment ledger, negotiate access to Vane documents, or confront actual informed participants. No one clue alone automatically proves Cassian's order.
    trajectory: Witnesses may depart or destroy evidence on causal grounds; other recorded independent trails do not disappear just because the player misses one.
    discovered_information: {}
  ring_echo:
    cause: The ancient Ardent ring was made as an oath witness to preserve one border heir's memories when Greywatch fell under a broken hereditary oath. Three previous branches of Julian's present crisis occurred and were erased by this specific exhausted boundary working. In the third lost branch, Julian survived long enough to become bitter and tactically experienced, then saw the house fall after refusing to ask House Merewyn for aid. At that earlier crisis he feared that Merewyn's superior stores, money and marriage tie would let it absorb Ardent's charter; the fear was his, not an actual Merewyn takeover plan. Aldren had been assassinated by Cassian in that branch too, disrupting the route, yet Elowen and the acting signatory were still willing to consider help if asked. The echo of that older Julian, carrying fragmentary memories of all three lost branches, was bound into the ring when the ancient oath last rewound events. The time working has been consumed and cannot guarantee another loop.
    prior_events:
      - The iron ring had a mundane centuries-long family legend of bringing victory, with victories credited to it by oral tradition but no independently proved benefit.
      - In each erased branch some initial circumstances matched the present, but changes in strategy and decisions created different histories.
      - The last older Julian wore the ring at the failure of the house, and his surviving memory became its captive witness.
      - Present Julian put it on last evening; it was silent and exhibited no effect.
    state:
      at_round_zero: Completely silent; not awakened, no proven victory-granting property or ongoing tactical bonus.
      manifestation_trigger: First deliberate defense decision Julian personally makes WHILE WEARING THE RING after a credible hostile assault against Greywatch is perceptible to him. If he takes the ring off or never commands, the trigger can remain unfulfilled. No voice is retroactively narrated before this event.
      emergence: Initially a rough, older voice audible only to Julian, offering a partial warning and pretending to be an ancestor or grandfather. No full automatic history dump. Later statements reflect remembered experience and its present limits.
      identity: An echo of Julian himself from the third erased timeline, not Edric, Aldren, a literal grandfather, or an omniscient oracle.
      behavior: Harsh and practical; regrets pride and silence, fears another collapse, may rationalize ruthless tactics, but cannot control Julian or speak directly to others.
      limit: Remembers specific past events and former enemy habits but has no present access to Cassian's thoughts, current scouts, exact unseen locations, future choices or unused plans. Its warnings can be inaccurate as history diverges. Cannot improve dice, teleport, confer abilities, create supplies or guarantee winning a war.
      alleged_victory: Victory is a family rumour before emergence and is STILL not a guaranteed outcome afterward. The soul's knowledge may provide useful testimony only when communicable and applicable, with normal feasibility and resolution.
    evidence:
      mannerisms: Older voice repeats Julian's private habit of counting lantern taps and knows an argument Julian had alone before his father's death; that supports intimacy, not instant proof of time travel.
      imperfect_foreknowledge: It can recall one former Sola feint and one former supply deadline, but changes and hidden developments may make these inaccurate.
      family_records: The ring and ancient oath markings are referenced by a chapel register and the Ardent household inventory, but none calls it an infallible victory artifact.
      memory_residue: Under recurring meaningful contacts, its accounts of Julian's choices and unresolved Merewyn letters can be compared to present artifacts and Julian's own experiences.
    routes: Assess the ring through repeated direct exchanges and inconsistency tests, compare family inventory and chapel oath writings, contrast remembered military facts with independent scouts, or pursue Merewyn correspondence and succession records. Revelation is not a mandatory mission or required confrontation.
    trajectory: The echo may offer advice if awakened, or never appear if Julian does not meet the trigger; the main invasion proceeds independently. The echo has no separate automatic world-pressure clock.
    discovered_information: {}
  boundary_claim:
    cause: The disputed toll line between the Old Creek and Greyfen causeway has an obsolete Crown survey which Vane interprets in its favor; Ardent holds a later locally witnessed grant with different markers. Cassian wants military leverage first and ratification second, not abstract destruction for its own sake.
    state: {record: Two conflicting charter interpretations, legal_status: unresolved dispute, actual_control: Ardent guards present crossings}
    evidence:
      arden_register: Orlo holds the witnessed later charter and toll ledger.
      crown_duplicate: Crown clerks retain a dated but disputed survey copy.
      merchant_usage: Merchants have receipts documenting which authority actually maintained the road and ferries.
      vane_petition: Cassian's negotiator has the opposing written legal argument.
    routes: Estate documents, merchants and prior toll users, Crown archives, or negotiation exposing Vane's petition. The military dispute cannot be resolved merely by saying a charter is correct.

## Setting notes (GM-facing)

- The assault resolves through actors and positions, not a clock. `boundary_encirclement` owns military isolation, `ration_shortage` the stores; never add parallel siege, convoy, famine or succession clocks. The Merewyn signature dispute belongs to the compact and the signatories' plans.
- The ring echo is a hidden case, not a pressure, quest or free ability. It wakes only on its exact trigger; its memories can be wrong as history diverges, and its identity may stay unknown.
- An appeal to Merewyn is judged on roads, signatories, risk and knowledge; neither pride nor the betrothal forbids or forces aid. Elowen is independent: neither a puppet nor hostile.
- 3-to-1 is the campaign-area ratio at Round 0, not a scripted outcome or one battle's numbers.
